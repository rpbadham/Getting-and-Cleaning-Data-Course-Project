#Code Book for *tidy_dataset.txt*#
Author: Richard Badham

This is the Code Book for **"tidy_dataset.txt"** which is the output file produced by executing **"run_analysis.R"**.

##Input##
The input data has been collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in the **'features.txt'** file accompanying the input data which was downloaded at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A description of **measurement units** is available in the **"README.txt"** file accompanying the input data.

##Script##
The script **"run_analysis.R"**

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Outputs to a data file called **"tidy_dataset.txt"** containing aggregated average values for the mean and standard deviation of each feature grouped by activity.

##Output##
The output file **"tidy_dataset.txt"** contains a dataset consisting of 66 columns and 6 rows.
There is one row for each of 6 activities listed in the first column. 

A complete description of the features in the remaining columns can be found in the file "features_info.txt".

A complete list of the columns follows.
* prefix "t" donates time domain signals.
* prefix "f" denotes frequency domain signals.

The 6 activities for which average values are output are: 
* LAYING
* SITTING
* STANDING
* WALKING
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
